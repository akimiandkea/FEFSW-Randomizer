# FEFSW-Randomizer
Unit and class randomizer for Fire Emblem Fates Silent Waves  
Double-click to run  
Only works on windows as far as I know? Other than that it's a command prompt so it should be fine  
Outputs a text file containing the characters, as well as the classes assigned if it was enabled  
Source code included (the python source file)  
Compiled through PyInstaller, but can be easily recompiled yourself  
Made by AkimiandKea from the Silent Waves discord, please message me with any bugs
