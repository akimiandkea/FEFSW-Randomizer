# FEFSW-Randomizer
Unit and class randomizer for Fire Emblem Fates Silent Waves \n
Double-click to run \n
Only works on windows as far as I know? Other than that it's a command prompt so it should be fine \n
Outputs a text file containing the characters, as well as the classes assigned if it was enabled \n
Source code included (the python source file) \n
Compiled through PyInstaller, but can be easily recompiled yourself \n
Made by AkimiandKea from the Silent Waves discord, please message me with any bugs
